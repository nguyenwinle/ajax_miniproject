# ajax_miniproject
This project requires me to pull api requests from Google maps, NY Times, and Wikipedia and build an application of loading content onto page when typing and submitting an address into the form using Javascript and jQuery.

Through this lesson, I learned that a lot of data is loaded asynchronously which refers to the fact that requests doesn't block other events from happening. AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) requests can load content without having to reload the page. It's happening in the background which doesn't block any other data. 

Some examples of AJAX requests occuring on a web page are Facebook and Twitter. When stories are loaded scrolling down the page, it's loading data asynchronously. Same goes for tweets on Twitter when scrolling down the Twitter page. 

# Instructions
1. Clone the repo and open the html page onto the browser.
2. Add an address on the top of page and submit.
3. Content will then be loaded based on the city.
